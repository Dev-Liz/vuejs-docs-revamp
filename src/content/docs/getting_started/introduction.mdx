## What is Vue?
**Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view)** is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. 
It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, 
component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces 
of any complexity.

#### Here is a minimal example:

```js title="example vue.js code"
import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'

createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count: ref(0)
    }
  }
}).mount('#app')
```
```js title="template"
<div id="app">
  <button @click="count++">
    Count is: {{ count }}
  </button>
</div>
```
#### Result
```js title="Result" "Counter is: 0" frame="none"
Counter is: 0
```

<Card title="The above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:">
  - Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax 
  that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.
  
  - Reactivity: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently 
  updates the DOM when changes happen.

  You may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little detail in the 
  rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you can have a high-level 
  understanding of what Vue offers.

<Aside type="note">
  The rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump 
  right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back! You can 
  check your knowledge level with these overviews for JavaScript, HTML and CSS if needed. 
  Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.
